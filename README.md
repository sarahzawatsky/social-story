# Social Story

Social Story is a social-emotional learning tool for people who are challenged by social and personal scenarios like transitions, personal care, and new experiences.

Social stories have traditionally been used to help autistic people learn about and process upcoming new experiences or to learn helpful strategies and behaviors when interacting in social situations.

A social story consists of images and brief captions that explain what is going to happen or what to do.  If a particular instance is likely to be a sensory trigger, the story might also include an affirmation such as 'I am okay' or offer a reminder of a solution such as 'I can put my headphones on'.

Authenticated ssers who create social stories using this app are able to crate stories by uploading a chapter name, a caption, and an image as a form.

# Unsolved Problems
- Users can currently see other users' resources in addition to edit/delete buttons.  In this context, these buttons are non-functional but are still un unnecessary and confusing to UX.
- Deleted story alert does not appear as a proper alert
- Chapters should be organized into stories:
  - User has many stories.  Stories have many chapters.  At this time the user actually only has one resource for chapters.
- Create a story.
- Edit a story title.
- Delete a story.
- Edit forms should populate previously entered and saved data.
- Ability to browse and favorite community gallery of stories.
- Ability to set some stories to public or private.
